        [Verse 1: Mickey Thomas] Lookin' in your eyes I see a paradise This
        world that I found is too good to be true Standin' here beside you Want
        so much to give you this love in my heart That I'm feelin' for you
      </p>

        [Pre-Chorus: Grace Slick] Let 'em say we're crazy, I don't care 'bout
        that Put your hand in my hand Baby, don't ever look back Let the world
        around us just fall apart Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart
      </p>
      <p>
        [Chorus: Both] And we can build this dream together Standing strong
        forever Nothing's gonna stop us now And if this world runs out of lovers
        We'll still have each other Nothing's gonna stop us Nothing's gonna stop
        us now Oh, whoa
      </p>
      <p>
        [Verse 2: Mickey Thomas] I'm so glad I found you, I'm not gonna lose you
        Whatever it takes I will stay here with you Take it to the good times
        See it through the bad times Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do
      </p>

        [Pre-Chorus: Grace Slick] Let 'em say we're crazy What do they know? Put
        your arms around me Baby, don't ever let go Let the world around us just
        fall apart Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart
      </p>
      <p>
        [Chorus: Both] And we can build this dream together Standing strong
        forever Nothing's gonna stop us now And if this world runs out of lovers
        We'll still have each other Nothing's gonna stop us Nothing's gonna stop
        us
      </p>
      <p>
        [Bridge: Mickey Thomas, Grace Slick, & Both] Ooh, all that I need is you
        All that I ever need And all that I want to do Is hold you forever and
        ever and ever, hey
      </p>
      <p>
        [Chorus: Both & Grace Slick] And we can build this dream together
        Standing strong forever Nothing's gonna stop us now And if this world
        runs out of lovers We'll still have each other Nothing's gonna stop us
        Nothing's gonna stop us, woah
      </p>
      <p>
        [Chorus: Both & Grace Slick] And we can build this dream together
        Standing strong forever Nothing's gonna stop us now (Nothing's gonna
        stop us now) If this world runs out of lovers We'll still have each
        other Nothing's gonna stop us (Oh, no)
      </p>
